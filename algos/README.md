Algo trading is to let computer execute the trading strategy. Xceder will implement the trading algo in 2 ways, 

1. Server modules 
    
    These are server programs and run in the server just as the xceder system modules 
    
2. Scripts

    These are still run in server side. But it relies on the script engine to interpret the scripts and execute the algo. In 
    theory, it will be slower than the server modules. But the advantage is the development speed is fast and almost can be revised
    instantly.
